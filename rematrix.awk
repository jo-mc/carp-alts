# Requirments
# directory fa with your fasta files   ~< 100M each
# directory scripts   (temp scripts written here)
# directory gff   outputs written here
# update email for failure messages from phoenix.

# AWK reimplementation of https://github.com/biogo/examples/blob/master/krishna/matrix/matrix.go
# Customised for Adelaide Uni phoenix HPC, 
#  uses phoenix $TMPDIR which is currently only on high mem nodes: but should be on others at some stage!
# build and submits scripts to run krishna

# Alter SBATCH settigns as requried, setting ran on 2G platypus genome, bundled to 80,000,000 
# Also set krishna filters/flags as required.

# Issues if jobs fail can be hard to track down, will be in slurm log file, and email of fail will go to nominated user.

# To test if scripts are created correctly, 
# comment out the two line with "command print...."  you can then verify scripts.
